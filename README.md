# Health-Impact-Study-

This global health based team seeks to discover the direct improvements to health in communities that constructed a AguaClara water treatment plant. Water borne diseases such as E. Coli,, cholera, giardia, and Typhoid can all be treated out of the water with an effective water treatment plant. It would be interesting and helpful for AguaClaraâ€™s marketing to explore and report the effect that our plants have had on communities around the globe. This team could explore plants in Honduras, Nicaragua, and India.
